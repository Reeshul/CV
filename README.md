I am a detail-oriented and self-driven **Full Stack Junior Developer**, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also gaining exposure to UX Design and product management.

After graduating from Warwick University with a STEM background in a degree in Maths and Stats, I spent over two years working with the small team at Save the Student to launch a matched betting service. From there I worked at other betting startups and grew curious why developers were always in high demand. I picked up JavaScript, and built a [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cheeky-betting-plugin/pkklclgbjgmbcdbdfcifffbegblnpabc/related) to help with calculate betting amounts, but I realised this was just the tip of the iceberg if I was serious about being a developer.

In June last year I worked as a frontend developer for SuperNova, exposing me what it's like to work on a development team on a real-world project. And before the turn of the year I enrolled in Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp. I have grown into a much more fully-fledged developer.

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, React, Redux, Sinatra, Bootstrap, Material Design, Material-UI.  
**Backend:** Ruby, Rails, Node.   
**Database:** PostgresQL, SQLite, Firebase.   
**Testing Frameworks:**  Jest, Cypress, Jasmine, RSpec, Capybara.  

## Notable Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [Sloth](https://github.com/reeshul/sloth)           | Final Makers project: a mobile app that fetches the user's step count from the phone's pedometer. Users can track their step count and earn a beautiful and (almost) unique sloth every day after reaching their daily target. | React Native, SecureStore, Jest |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/reeshul/acebook)           | A group project at Makers where the main goal was to mirror as closely as possibly a typical dev team's development process. A full stack CRUD application where users can post messages on other profiles. Deployed [to Heroku](http://hemo-acebook.herokuapp.com/) following a CI/CD pipeline.  | Rails, CircleCI |
| [Chitter](https://github.com/reeshul/chitter)           | One of many weekend challenges at Makers: this task was to build a Twitter-like app that connects to a database following the MVC architecture and TDD principles. (Recently updated) | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgresQL , Capybara, RSpec|

## Skills

#### Analytical thinker

I love solving a good Kata on codewars. Before Makers I practised a lot of JS on there and completed the data structures and algorithms [certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/reeshul/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures) on freeCodeCamp.

In my role at Save the Student I would test different advertising strategies and monitor the efficacy of each to identify what would result in the most traffic. My ability to think analytically also played a role in my ability to solve problems on my final project during Makers. When faced with multiple blockers within my code I was able to think outside the box in a logical manner which helped me move forward at an effective rate.

#### Team player and effective communicator

At Makers I partook in several group projects where we would follow Agile methodologies to complete applications to a deadline. At the same time we had the chance to practice XP practises, such as discussing what we felt the MVP should be, how it would be tested, and the priorities and feasibility of other features to be added in later sprints.

During my time volunteering at SuperNova I would review other volunteers’ code and take on feedback from others regarding my own. It was a hugely rewarding experience where I truly appreciated the diversity of knowledge the team shared.

## Experience

**Makers Academy** (Nov '20 - Mar '21)  
_Software Engineering Student_

Immersive software development course where I honed in on the following skills:

- **Agile methodologies**<br />
I employed agile methodologies to work successfully in a team for multiple projects: such as sprint planning and daily standups.
- **Domain-driven design**<br />
Given project requirements we created user stories, broke the stories down into objects and actions, diagrammed relationships for these, defined the MVP’s features, broke the features down into smaller tasks. 
- **Test driven development and behaviour driven development**<br />
I encouraged test driving code when feasible: writing meaningful tests (based on the requirements) and then the minimal code to pass those.
- **Pair programming**<br />
I utilised my communication skills to frequently pair with multiple peers in my cohort.
- **XP Values**<br />
After group project sprints or pair programming I gave/received feedback and sought to keep features as simple as possible.
